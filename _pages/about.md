Welcome to Shangwen Wang's (王尚文) homepage!

Currently, I am a Ph.D student at National University of Defense Technology (will obtain my Ph.D degree soon in December 2023!). I have obtained my bachelor degree and master degree from NUDT at June, 2017 and December, 2019, respectively. During my master study, I was honored to be supervised by Prof. Xiaoguang Mao. My research interests mainly focus on AI4SE, program repair, software testing, software maintenance and evolution, mining software repositories, and empirical software engineering. 

From May 2022 to July 2023, I was a visiting student at Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), supervised by Prof. [Yepang Liu](https://yepangliu.github.io/).
