Welcome to Shangwen Wang's (王尚文) homepage. Currently, I am a Ph.D student at National University of Defense Technology. I have obtained my bachelor degree and master degree from NUDT at June, 2017 and December, 2019, respectively. During my master study, I was honored to be supervised by Prof. Xiaoguang Mao. My research interests mainly focus on program repair, software testing, and mining software repositories. Recently, I begin to use deep learning techniques for solving software engineering problems.

NEWS! Our work on patch overfitting has been accepted by [ASE'20](https://conf.researchr.org/home/ase-2020) (07/2020). Good job!
